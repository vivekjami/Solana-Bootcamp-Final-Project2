## Overview

The **Budget Tracker** provides a user-friendly interface to participate in Ethereum-based actions.The purpose of this contract is to track the income and outcome of a given user. For this contract, we are going to target the Solana blockchain. Thus, we define the data structure **Record** that will be transpile to a PDA Account base on the seeds defined in the solana extension. In addition, the contract defines three methods, also known as instruction; through this method, we add behavior.
## Features

- create_user_record: To call once per account. Initialize a Record account. The total_balance of the account will be set to 0.

- register_income: Register income of the user.

- register_outcome: Register outcome of the user.
